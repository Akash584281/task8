This project applies K-Means clustering to segment customers based on their Annual Income and Spending Score using the Mall Customers dataset. The dataset is first scaled using StandardScaler, and the optimal number of clusters is identified using the Elbow Method. After fitting the K-Means model, clusters are visualized in a 2D plot with distinct colors for each group. Finally, the Silhouette Score is calculated to evaluate the quality of the clustering. This project demonstrates key concepts in unsupervised learning and cluster evaluation using Scikit-learn, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
